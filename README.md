## ABI_Solitaire
A solitaire game I wrote many years ago during my off-time and during night guard shifts when I was serving with the US Army in northern Iraq.


This code is very, very old (circa 2004) and has not been maintained in many years.  I have had some success building it under Visual Studio as new as 2010 SP1.  If I recall correctly, non-unicode support must be enabled by default for the stdio library.  I believe that this is configured somewhere in the project defines.    

This code was released some time back on an old Sourceforge account which I have since lost (and was probably closed due to inactivity).  I am bringing it forward to GitHub in the hopes that someone may find it useful.
