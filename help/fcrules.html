Rules<br>
<br>
</font></span>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><font
 size="+1">General:</font></span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four Corners is played using 52 cards - Ace
through King in four suits.&nbsp; The Ace is both the high and low card.<br>
<br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Board:</span></font><br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The board is divided up into 3 sections: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1:&nbsp; The main board - Cards are
placed in 5 columbs in descending value.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2:&nbsp; The four corners - cards are
moved here in suit and ascending sequence, the upper left corner
contains the starting card.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3:&nbsp; The draw / discard pile.&nbsp;
The draw pile initially contains the remaining 46 cards.<br>
<br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Main Board:</span></font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The main board consists of three rows
and three columbs like a tic-tac-toe board.&nbsp; The outer four
corners are effectively the goal section of the game.&nbsp; The five
center positions are dealt one card each and the upper - left hand
corner is dealt a card.&nbsp; The last carrd dealt is the start
card.&nbsp; Each of the four corners are started with the card of the
same face value as the start carrd, but more on this later.&nbsp; The
remainder of this section covers the rules for the five central
columbs.&nbsp; Cards can be moved to this section in descending
order.&nbsp; Only the face value of the card is important in this
section, the suit or color does not matter.&nbsp; I.E.&nbsp; Any 9 may
be played on a 10 of spades.&nbsp; There is no limit as to how deep
each columb gets.<br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
The Four Corners of the Main Board:</span></font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The objective of the game is to move
all of the cards to the four corners.&nbsp; This is done by starting
with the cards with the same value as the start card and moving the
cards to the corners in increasing value by suit.<br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Draw / Discard
Pile:<br>
</span></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Cards are turned over one
at a time from the draw pile.&nbsp; The cards can be moved to the main
board or the discard pile.&nbsp; The top card in the discard pile can
still be played, revealing the next card. &nbsp; <br>
