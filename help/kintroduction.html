<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Klondike 2 to the best of my
knowledge was developed
some time in the early 80's by my father as a modification to the
classic klondike game (what most people call solitaire).&nbsp; The
biggest advantage of this game over it's pretecessor is that it allows
the player to make many more choices as to how to play the cards.&nbsp;
This makes the game much more difficult.&nbsp; Thankfully, this game
supports unlimited undo which any avid player of this game will need
desperately.&nbsp; I have found this to be the case.&nbsp; Well, I hope
that you enjoy playing the game and of course, good luck.&nbsp; <br>
