Rules<br>
<br>
</font></span>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><font
 size="+1">General:</font></span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calculation is played using 52 cards - Ace
through King in four suits.&nbsp; The King is a high card, and the Ace
is low - kind of...<br>
<br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Board:</span></font><br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The board is divided up into 3 sections: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1:&nbsp; The main board - Cards can be
placed in any one of four columbs in any order.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2:&nbsp; The goal section - When all
cards have been moved up here, the game is won.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3:&nbsp; The draw pile.&nbsp;
The draw pile initially contains the remaining 48 cards.<br>
<br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Main Board:</span></font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The main board consists of 4 empty
columbs.&nbsp; Cards can be moved from the draw pile to any one of the
four columbs in any order.&nbsp; Cards must be stored here until ready
to be moved to the top.&nbsp; Although there are no criteria to placing
cards here, only the last card in a columb may be played.&nbsp;
Therefore care should be taken when placing cards here as to not block
cards necessary for play by ones that cannot be played soon.<br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
The Goal Section:</span></font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The goal section begins with four
columbs containing the Ace of Spades, 2 of Diamonds, 3 of Clubs, and 4
of Hearts respectively.&nbsp; Thus, the score begins with 4.&nbsp; The
objective of the game is to move all of the cards here, in order.&nbsp;
In order to move a card here it's value must be the next in
sequence.&nbsp; The sequence starts with Ace then 2 - 10 then Jack,
Queen, and King.&nbsp; Then the pattern repeats.&nbsp; The suit of the
card does not really matter, what matters is the series of the
card.&nbsp; The first columb, beginning with the Ace increments by
1.&nbsp; To move cards here you must place any 2, then any 3, and so
forth.&nbsp; In the second columb, the sequence increments by 2.&nbsp;
Thus you must move a 4, then a 6, etc.&nbsp; The third columb increases
to 3 and the fourth, 4.&nbsp; Each pile is completed when a King has
been placed on it.&nbsp; The game has been won when all four piles have
kings on them.&nbsp; <br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Draw Pile:<br>
</span></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Cards are turned over one
at a time from the draw pile.&nbsp; The cards must either be moved to
the goal section, if possible, or to the main board.&nbsp; The draw
pile starts with the remaining 48 cards after the cards for the goal
have been removed.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><font
 size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Goal:<br>
</span></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The goal of calculation
is to move all of the cards to the top of the board, the goal section
in order.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Good
Luck!&nbsp; And, Enjoy! :-)<br>
