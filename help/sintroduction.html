 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Streets and Alleys was developed
some time in the early 80's by my Grandmother.. I believe.&nbsp; Either
way, I was not there so I really can't tell you.&nbsp; I origionally
wrote this game in QBasic using text based sprites for the cards and a
small assembly program for the mouse.&nbsp; Recently, I finally decided
to port it to something more modern, C++.&nbsp; This is one of the
first major projects that I have tried to write in a while.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the future, I plan to move much of the drawing
functions to a library, and possibly make libs out of the game
classes.&nbsp; Also, I will most likely write more games, perhaps a 4
player version of war and a spades game.&nbsp; <br>
