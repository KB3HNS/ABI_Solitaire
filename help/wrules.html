&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; War is played with 52 cards:&nbsp; 2 through Ace in
each f the 4 suits.&nbsp; Each player reveals the top card of their
deck.&nbsp; The player whose card is the greatest value wins both
cards.&nbsp; Cards range from 2 to Ace, with the Ace being the top
card.&nbsp; If the card values are equal, the players enter a
"War."&nbsp; If a player has exhausted their cards, they flip their
discard pile over and that becomes their play deck.&nbsp; The game is
over when one player has all 52 cards.&nbsp; That player is the winner.<br>

</font><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In a war, each player takes 2 cards from the top their deck and places
them face down on top of the cards that are at war.&nbsp; Then they
take the next card and place it face up.&nbsp; If a player does not
have enough cards, the last card is placed face up.&nbsp; The player
whose card is the greatest value wins the war, and all the cards
involved.&nbsp; In the event that both players have cards of the same
value, the War repeats until one player wins.&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></span>Cards are selected by clicking on
them or pressing the enter key.&nbsp; You may view any of your cards,
including those in your play stack, but you can not view cards in your
opponent's play stack.&nbsp; Selecting a card will move it to the
center of the board.&nbsp; The PC will then reveal it's next
card.&nbsp; The cards are displayed for 1 second and then the winner is
calculated.&nbsp; In the event of a war, the program will draw your
cards for you and display them for 1 second before proceding.&nbsp; <br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note*&nbsp;
There is NO undo in War! (Restarts are acceptable).<br>
