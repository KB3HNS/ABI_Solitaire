</font></span>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><font
 size="+1">General:</font></span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klondike is played using 52 cards - Ace
through King in four suits.&nbsp; The Ace is the low card and the king
is the high card.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Board:</span></font><br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The board is divided up into 2 sections: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1:&nbsp; The main board - 7 columbs of
cards dealt as follows: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - Columb
1:&nbsp; 2 down, 3 up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2 - Columb
2:&nbsp; 4 down, 5 up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3 - Columb
3:&nbsp; 6 down, 6 up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 4 - Columb
4:&nbsp; 5 down, 6 up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 5 - Columb
5:&nbsp; 3 down, 5 up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 6 - Columb
6:&nbsp; 1 down, 4 up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 7 - Columb
7:&nbsp; 2 up<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2:&nbsp; The Goal Section:&nbsp; 4
columbs to move the cards to.<br>
<br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Main Board:</span></font><br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cards are dealt to the main board one row at a time.&nbsp; The first
row is dealt from left to right, then the secont row is dealt from
right to left.&nbsp; The down cards and the first up card in each row
are dealt before any other up cards are dealt.&nbsp; This will quickly
yield an alternating pattern when dealt manually.&nbsp; Cards are moved
from columb to columg by selecting one card in a columb and then
placing it on the bottom of another columb.&nbsp; Cards operate in
alternating colors in descending order.&nbsp; Ex:&nbsp; a black 3 can
go on a red 4 reguardless of what is on top of the 3.&nbsp; When this
happens, the whole columb, from the 3 on down, is appended to the
columb that terminated with the 4.&nbsp; When there are no more face up
cards in a columb, the first face down card may be turned face
up.&nbsp; This is done by clicking on the card or using the arrow kays
to turn it face up.&nbsp; When there are no more face down cards left
the columb is empty.&nbsp; Only a King can be placed on an empty
columb.&nbsp; Like other moves, the king does not have to be the last
card in a stack in order to move it to an empty columb.&nbsp; When a
king is moved, everything that is on top of the King follows it.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><font
 size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Goal Section:<br>
</span></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The objective of Klondike 2 is
to move all of the cards from main board to the goal section.&nbsp;
There are 4 positions in the place board, one for each
suit.&nbsp; Cards are moved up to the goal section in ascending order
starting with the Ace.&nbsp; Once a card has been moved to the place
board, it is
considered out of play and can not be moved back to the main
board.&nbsp; When all 52 cards have been moved to the goal section, the
game is won. &nbsp; <br>
