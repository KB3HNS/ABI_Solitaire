run for the first time, the program will bring up an "Open" dialog box
asking you for the location of the solitaire bitmap card images.&nbsp;
This is in the subdirectory "bitmap" of wherever you unpacked the
solitaire binaries.&nbsp; After you do this, the game creates a
registry entry in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/ABI/Solitaire called
bitmaps location.&nbsp; If the software is ever moved, this key needs
to be deleted or updated with the new path information.&nbsp; The
easiest way to accomplish this is to do the following:<br>
<br>
1&nbsp; - go to Start &gt; Run<br>
2&nbsp; - enter "regedit" and press [enter]<br>
3&nbsp; - A window will appear, on the left there will appear an icon
with "My Computer" written next to it.&nbsp; If, to the left of that
icon, there is a "-" sign, skip to step 5.<br>
4&nbsp; - Click on the + sign next to the "My Computer" icon.<br>
5&nbsp; - Several folders will appear with capitol names and "+"
marks.&nbsp; Click on the "+" next to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE"<br>
6&nbsp; - The tree will expand.&nbsp; Look for "SOFTWARE" and click on
the "+" mark.&nbsp; <br>
7&nbsp; - The tree will expand again.&nbsp; Look for "ABI" and click on
the FOLDER.<br>
8&nbsp; - Hit the &lt;Delete&gt; button.&nbsp; A dialog box will appear
asking you to confirm that you want to delete that key.&nbsp; Click
"Yes".<br>
9&nbsp; - Close the program.<br>
<br>
This will delete the key and cause the program to again ask you where
the bitmaps are located.&nbsp; Select the new location.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:&nbsp; </span>The images must be
in a subfolder of the game labeled bitmaps in order for the game to
work properly.&nbsp; If, after you have started a new game, you don't
see any cards, it is because the location in the registry is
incorrect.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
P.S.&nbsp; Yes, I am working on a more modern way of deploying this
application.<br>
