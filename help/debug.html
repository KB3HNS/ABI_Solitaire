<span style="color: rgb(255, 204, 255);"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Release builds utilize the Dummy class which is a child of Solitaire
until a gametype is specified (i.e. through loading a file, or
selecting a new game).&nbsp; This was done so the game pointer would be
valid at all times while the system was in the infinite loop.&nbsp; The
class is created immediately after the window is opened and is deleted
immediately before a real game class is used.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A macro defined in debug.h is used to determine if
the build is a debug or release build.&nbsp; For debug builds, the
Dummy class is replaced with an instance of dbgDummy.&nbsp; (See
debug.h, and Solitaire.cpp for how this is done).&nbsp; The dbgDummy
class allows for easy testing of the graphics drawing routines.&nbsp;
It can be utilized as follows:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left Click:&nbsp; Draw Card at X, Y<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right Click:&nbsp; Draw Inverted card at X, Y<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right: Rotate card clockwise 1 degree<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left: Rotate card counter-clockwise 1 degree<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up:&nbsp; Zoom in by a factor of .1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down:&nbsp; Zoom out by a factor of .1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter:&nbsp; Cycle to the next card<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deal():&nbsp; reset values.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; redrawBoard();&nbsp; clear board<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, method ::gameName() returns "dbgDummy"
instead of "Dummy"<br>
In each instance that a card is either drawn, or redrawn, the class
calls the appropriate eraseCard() call befor calling drawCard()<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><font size="+2">Additional information
about Debug builds:<br>
<font size="+1">The Debug Window:&nbsp; </font></font></span>Debug
builds open up an additional window labeled Debug Output.&nbsp; This
window is, for all intents and purposes, a console window.&nbsp; The
window is a subprocess of the Solitaire application.&nbsp; Closing this
window will send a close message to the parent and terminate the
application.&nbsp; I haven't been able to create a perfect console
window, so the current one has the following limitations:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No scroll capability<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Text is erased if&nbsp; another window is on top of
it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '\n' is not properly processed.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Newline is automatically assumed.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a malloc() memory hole (windows specific?)
that will throw an exception if too many dprintf messages are processed
(over 200 usually).<br>
To print information out to the debug window, call dprintf().&nbsp; The
syntax is identical to that of printf().&nbsp; In a non debug build,
the dprintf() statement will exist but will not do anything.&nbsp; <br>
Since cardtools is moving to an independant library, the debug version
of this library will open up a window of it's own.&nbsp; <br>
