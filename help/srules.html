- Game Rules<br>
<br>
</font></span>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><font
 size="+1">General:</font></span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Streets and alleys is played using 52 cards - 2 -
Ace in four suits.&nbsp; The Ace counts as both a low and high card and
cards cycle through it.&nbsp; ex:&nbsp; K, A, 2.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Board:</span></font><br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The board is divided up into 3 sections: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1:&nbsp; The main board - 3 rows of 5
columns, up to 3 cards deep.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2:&nbsp; The "Free" board - 1 row of 3
columns, up to 3 cards deep.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3:&nbsp; The "Place" board - 2 rows of
2 columns.<br>
<br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Main Board:</span></font><br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the main board, cards can be placed in descending order alternating
colors.&nbsp; ex:&nbsp; Queen of hearts, Jack of clubs, 10 of
diamonds.&nbsp; Each pile can have up to 3 cards in it.&nbsp; Once the
last card in a pile has been removed, that pile may no longer be
used.&nbsp; It starts out completely full.<br>
<br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The "Free" Board:</span></font><br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cards in the free board can be placed in ascending or descending order
alternating colors.&nbsp; ex:&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 spades, 6 hearts, 7
spades.&nbsp; Having both ascending and descending in a pile is
acceptable.&nbsp; ex:&nbsp; 3 diamonds, 4 clubs, 3 hearts.&nbsp; Once a
pile in the free board has been depleted, any card can be placed to
restart a pile.&nbsp; At the beginning of the game, each pile in the
free board contains only 2 of the 3 possible cards in it.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The "Place" board:<br>
</span></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The objective of Streets and Alleys is
to move all of the cards from the place and main boards to the free
board.&nbsp; There are 4 positions in the place board, one for each
suit.&nbsp; The first position is automatically dealt a card to begin
the game.&nbsp; To start the other 3 positions, you must place the same
value card, of a different suit.&nbsp; ex:&nbsp; if the first position
began with a 8 of clubs, the 2nd position must be started with any
other 8.&nbsp; Once a card has been moved to the place board, it is
considered out of play and can not be moved back to the main or free
boards.&nbsp; Cards are moved to the place board in ascending order by
suit.&nbsp; ex:&nbsp; 7 diamond, 8 diamond, 9 diamond.&nbsp; Each time
a card is moved to the place board, the score increases by one.&nbsp;
Each game starts out with a score of 1.&nbsp; When the score reaches
52, the game has been won.&nbsp; <br>

Luck!&nbsp; And, Enjoy! :-)<br>
