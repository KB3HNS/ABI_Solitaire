Rules<br>
<br>
</font></span>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><font
 size="+1">General:</font></span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyrimid is played using 52 cards - Ace
through King in four suits.&nbsp; The Ace is the low card and the King
is the high card.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Board:</span></font><br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The board is divided up into 2 sections: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1:&nbsp; The main board - Cards are
dealt here in a pyrimid fashion in 7 rows.&nbsp; 1 card in the first,
centered.&nbsp; 2 in the second, etc.&nbsp; All the way to row 7 which
contains 7 cards for a total of 28.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2:&nbsp; The draw / discard pile.&nbsp;
The draw pile initially contains the remaining 24 cards.<br>
<br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Main Board:</span></font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The cards in the main board can be
selected and played only on the following criteria.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; There are no
cards directly below the card.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; You are trying to
match a card with the only card below it.&nbsp; <br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
The Draw / Discard Pile:<br>
</span></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Cards are turned over one
at a time from the draw pile.&nbsp; They can either be played or moved
to the discard pile which is directly to the right.&nbsp; If a card is
moved to the discard pile, not all is lost.&nbsp; The top discarded
card may be played along with the top card in the draw pile.&nbsp;
Those cards can also be matched and played.&nbsp; Any card that meets
the selection criteria can be used to match.<br>
<br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><font
 size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Goal:<br>
</span></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The objective of pyrimid
is to eliminate all of the cards.&nbsp; Every time one or two cards are
matched, they are eliminated from the game.&nbsp; When all cards have
been eliminated, from the draw pile, discard pile, and pyrimid, the
game is won.&nbsp; Cards in the discard pile can not be moved to the
main board.&nbsp; <br>
<br>

Luck!&nbsp; And, Enjoy! :-)<br>
